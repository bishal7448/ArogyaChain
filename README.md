# Medical Health Management Blockchain Dapp (ArogyaChain)

Build & Deploy a Medical Health Management Blockchain Dapp | Solidity, Hardhat, Next.js, Context AP and web3 providers

In this comprehensive tutorial, we will guide you through the process of building and deploying a Medical Health Management Dapp on the blockchain. This step-by-step video covers everything from setting up the development environment to deploying the smart contracts and building a user-friendly frontend.

✨ Features:
✅ Decentralized Medical Records – Securely store and access medical history on the blockchain. 
✅ Tokenized Rewards – Patients earn tokens for completing medical tests or checkups. 
✅ Doctor-Patient Interaction – Connect with verified healthcare professionals securely. 
✅ Immutable & Transparent – Prevents data tampering and unauthorized access. 
✅ IPFS-based Storage – Efficiently stores medical reports and prescriptions. 
✅ Secure User Authentication – Non-custodial wallets ensure user privacy.
